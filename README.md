## Charlotte theme

There are a *lot* of Obsidian themes out there, but I couldn't find exactly what I wanted. Charlotte theme is a theme in progress aiming to address my specific wants which I haven't been able to find elsewhere:
  1. Off-white colour pallette which is easy on the eyes over long periods of time
  2. More than one highlight colour
  3. Colourful and aesthetically appealing without being a distraction
  4. Clean dark mode which doesn't have the 'muddy' look that I see in a lot of themes
  5. My particular fondness for serif fonts

I'm able to focus for the longest periods when reading paper books, so that's what I'm going for here.
